# Azure Application Gateway + Key Vault TLS (Cert Rotation) â€” Lab

A minimal, reproducible lab to front a simple HTTP backend with **Azure Application Gateway (Standard_v2)**, terminate TLS with a certificate stored in **Azure Key Vault**, and test **certificate rotation** (new Key Vault secret version) with **zero downtime**.

> This README only includes **working, battle-tested commands**. Any false starts are removed so others can follow this end-to-end without surprises.

## Backend: Hello Flask on Ubuntu (HTTP :80)

## Certificate Rotation Notes

- **Rotation:** Import a new PFX version into the existing `appgw-cert` object.  
- **Polling:** AppGW checks Key Vault every ~4 hours. New sessions use the updated version automatically.  
- **Rollback:** Point AGW back to an older Secret Identifier, or disable the newest version in Key Vault.

---

## Checking Which Cert AGW is Using

You can confirm which Key Vault secret version App Gateway is actively referencing:

```bash
az network application-gateway ssl-cert show   -g "$RG" --gateway-name "$APPGW" -n kv-cert   --query keyVaultSecretId -o tsv
```

This outputs the **exact Key Vault secret version** AGW is bound to.

---

## Restart / Refresh

To nudge AGW immediately (instead of waiting 4 hours):

```bash
az network application-gateway update -g "$RG" -n "$APPGW"
# or restart
az network application-gateway restart -g "$RG" -n "$APPGW"
```

---

## Cleanup

```bash
az group delete -n "$RG" --yes --no-wait
```
